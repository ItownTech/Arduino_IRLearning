------
In this project, the Arduino will learn your IR Commands, and save the IR code to EEPROM, it can save many IR codes, the Specific IR Commands 
depending on the size of the EEPROM.

## IRLearning_WithoutLib

This is a demo without IR Learning Library, in this demo , the Arduino will store 20 items of IR Commands

##irlearn
This is a demo using IR Learning Library, it can save at most 50 items of IR Commands, you can change the irlearning.h file to configure the demo according to your own project.
